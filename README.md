# Aurebesh Font

A Star Wars fan font.

> In a galaxy far, far away // no wait, it was right here on earth!

I had just bought a Aurebesh keycap set for a keyboard of mine, and wanted to install a font ... alas ... not as simple as I thought.

So I set out to create my own.

- [This **Wookieepedia** article](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Aurebesh) seems to be the definitive definition of the Aurebesh character set.
    - But it's missing a whole bunch of font-able characters needed for a font, most notably the numerals *(0-9)*, some of the mathematical operators *("+", "=", etc.)*, and some of the other often used characters *("~", "{", "[", "@", and so on)*.
- The keycaps seem to have been made based on the Neale Davidson's *(from [pixelsagas.com](https://pixelsagas.com))* **Aurebesh** font.
    - But that font has the capital letters turned around! (?)
    - This to me was nonsensical, as the definition of Aurebesh does not support that assumption.
    - However it is the most widely used Aurebesh font *(an assumption I'm making based on how many sites have it for download!)*
    - Other variants, like **Aurebesh Cantina**, have also adopted this horizontal inversion for capitals.
    - And yet others, like **AurekBesh Hand**, have not *(alas, that font also uses another discrepancy, in that the numerals being dot-count based, and not the more common western numerals used in the fore-mentioned fonts)*.
- The closest to true representation of the **Aurebesh** font was made by Yari Leferink, from  [aurebesh.org](https://aurebesh.org) - his work was the closest to "true" I could find, but I wanted a font that was closer to some of the characters on my keyboard.

## This work

This work is yet another version of the Aurebesh font, built with [BirdFont](https://birdfont.org/) and released under the [SIL Open Font License (OFL-1.1)](LICENSE.md).

Get the font file from here [dist/Aurebesh.ttf](https://github.com/vinorodrigues/font-aurebesh/raw/main/dist/Aurebesh.ttf).

## Features:
* Correct canon uppercase characters.  Uppercase characters are however 10% larger - just subtle enough to be visible as a capital.
* Numerals are represented as western numerals-like characters.

## To do:
* Lit. sporting extended legends for "ch", "ae", "eo", "kh", "ng", "oo", "sh" and "th".
